# Code Book for tidy.txt

The file "tidy.txt" is generated by the `run_analysis.R` script. It contains summary information of the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). The raw file from which this data set is generated is available: [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). For more details on reproducing this data set, see: [README.md](README.md).

## Format

The rows of the file are separated by UNIX newline characters ('\n'). The columns of the file are separated by white space. The first line of the file is the header. Text values, including the column names in the header, are surrounded by quotation marks ('"').

## Variables

The first column of the file is the subject identifier. This matches the subject identifiers of the raw data exactly. It is an integer value that uniquely identifies one of the volunteers.

The second column of the file is a categorical variable representing the activity that a volunteer performed while wearing a smartphone. The six possible values are:
* WALKING
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
* SITTING
* STANDING
* LAYING

The remaining 86 columns are averages of the mean and standard deviation features from the raw data set aggregated for each unique subject, activity combination. These are continuous variables in the domain: [-1, 1]. There are no missing values

## Summary

There were 30 volunteers for the experiments and 6 activities measured for each volunteer. Therefore there are 180 records in this tidy data set. The raw data included 86 mean and standard deviation variables and so there are 86 columns in this data set that represent the averages of those variables.

This was prepared by Carlos Macasaet for course project for the [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata) course of the [Data Science specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1) offered by Johns Hopkins University and Coursera.
